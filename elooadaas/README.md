### Introduction

Hungarian object agreement can generally be described as being sensitive to
definiteness, but there are a few of exceptions from that generalisation.  One
of these exceptions are **possessed direct objects**. This do not have to be
definite, yet in Standard Hungarian they always seem to trigger object
agreement, with linguists reporting dialectal variation.

In this talk, we present the results of a series of online surveys that attempt
assess the existence of this dialectal variation and locate it; the theoretical
goal is to develop a better understanding of what it is that triggers object
agreement in Hungarian.

### Examples

Hungarian transitive verbs always agree with the subject, but have a separate
set of suffixes that reference a certain property of the direct object:

```
(1)     Mari    lát     egy kutyá-t.
        M.      see.3SG a   dog-ACC
        ‘Mari sees a dog.’

(2)     Mari    lát-ja      a   kutyá-t.
        M.      see-3SG.OBJ the dog-ACC
        ’Mari sees the dog.’
```

While definiteness is a fairly good predictor of when object agreement appears,
there are exceptions relating to personal pronouns (den Dikken 2004, 2006,
Coppock 2013, É. Kiss 2013, Bárány 2015) and possessed DOs (Szabolcsi 1994, den
Dikken 1999, Bartos 1999).

In Hungarian possessive constructions, the possessum has an overt possessive
suffix indicating the person and number of its possessor. Everything apart from
the possessum with its suffix is optional. There are several types of
possessors:

- pronominal possessors (én, te, ő, etc.), which always co-occur with a definite determiner:
    - az én ház-am
- nominative possessors, which are in complementary distribution with the definite determiner:
    - Mari háza
- dative possessors, which can appear with a definite determiner, and precede it:
    - Marinak a háza
- null possessors:
    - a háza / a házad / ...

The distribution of the possessors with respect to the definite determiner
suggests that there are (at least) three positions for the possessor:

- below D for pronouns
- in the projection of D for nominative possessors (a kind of filter akin to a doubly-filled COMP?)
- above the projection of D

Further evidence for these structures comes from possessor extraction.
Hungarian lacks a *habeo*-verb and uses a *mihi est*-strategy to express a
possession relation in a clause:

```
(3)     Mari-nak    van macská-ja.
        M.-DAT      is  cat-3SG.POSS
        ‘Mari has a cat.’
```

Possessors in this construction have to be dative (or null). Szabolcsi (1994)
shows that in this construction, the (dative) possessor does not form a
constituent with the possessed noun. The logic is as follows: Hungarian has a
pre-verbal focus position that houses one constituent. Focus particles like
csak ‘only’ force a constituent into that position. The possessor and the
possessum cannot appear in the focus position together:

```
(4)     *Csak   Mari-nak    macská-ja       van.
        only    M.-DAT      cat-3SG.POSS    is
```

Szabolcsi argues that this extraction has to do with the interpretation of the
possessed noun phrase: in clausal possessive constructions, the possessed noun
has to be non-specific (cf. also English *`*I have the sister.`*). She argues
that for the varieties of Hungarian speakers that allow possessed DOs without
object agreement, this extraction is necessary too.

Bartos (1999), assuming that all and only DPs trigger object agreement,
explains this by suggesting that extracted possessors can extract from above DP
or below DP; in the latter case, the DO does not project a DP and the verb does
not agree with the DO.

### Surveys

In order to assess the validity of both the empirical claims and the
theoretical explanations, we conducted a series of surveys which first assessed
the occurrence of non-agreeing direct objects, as well as the interpretation of
a potential null determiner in the noun phrase that is present with nominative
and dative possessors.

### Methodology

### Findings

### Theoretical implications

The lack of acceptability of non-agreeing DOs is striking and has several
implications:

- more surveys, more contexts
- object agreement is not sensitive to the interpretation of the DO but is determined syntactically
- for syntactic triggers, there are still two options:
    - the possessive suffix (plus accusative)
    - the DP structure of the noun phrase
        - although we don't have a good idea of what silent structure there is; so this is speculative

The latter is compatible with work following Bartos (1999); the former would
have correlates in several Finno-Ugric languages and is reminiscent of work by
Coppock and Wechsler (2012), Coppock (2013).

Could the possessive suffix itself be the trigger of object agreement? Coppock
(2013) argues for a semantic interpretation of Hungarian object agreement,
based on anaphoricity, suggesting that each trigger of object agreement is
anaphoric and introduces an existential presupposition. This is clearly not the
case with possessive suffixes, however:

```
(5)     Mari-nak    nincs   macská-ja.
        M.-DAT      not.is  cat-3SG.POSS
        ’Mari doesn't have a cat.’
```

(5) asserts that Mari doesn't have a cat and does not presuppose such a cat's
existence.

Syntactically, possessed noun phrases do not necessarily form a natural class
with other types of noun phrases triggering object agreement, which include
definite noun phrases, proper names, noun phrases with presuppositional
determiners (*melyik* ‘which’, *mindegyik* ‘each’), etc. (although CP
complements also trigger object agreement and do not obviously form part of the
same natural class).

They do form a natural class if their possessors are taken into account:
nominative and pronominal possessors clearly require a DP projection — but
dative possessors less obviously so. They are compatible with an overt definite
determiner, but is there evidence for a null determiner?

### További megjegyzések

#### Igék

A második felmérésben a harmadik blokkban ilyeneket néztünk meg:

```
Ádám keresett/kereste Monetnek tájképét.
Juli talált/találta az írónak regényét.
```

É. Kiss (2000) a “talál”-igét használja az ilyen mondatokban, mert azt mondja,
hogy az nem-specifikus tárgyat követel; a “keres“ meg intenzionális ige, tehát
nincs preszuppozició hogy létezik a tárgy. Lehet, hogy ezek arra utalnak, hogy
itt valamilyen szemantikai konfliktus van.

#### Baranya, Hajdú-Bihar

Itt elfogadhatóbbak voltak a mondatok az alanyi ragozással; itt a névelő
nélküli birtokosok is jobbak?

### Eredmények

- Geographical distribution: Hajdú-Bihar and Baranya have some speakers who
  allow subject agreement with possessed DOs?

- In general: difficult to find judgments confirming what is reported in the
  literature.

- Object agreement with indefinite possessed direct objects definitely happens
  (and is quite acceptable), so there is a clear difference between these
structures and non-possessed noun phrases

- Could this be a DP layer?

- What's the role of D? Dative possessors with null determiners aren't very
  good (in general and compared to dative possessors with determiners);

- But either D or Num is fine — and null D is fine with nominative possessors

- If presuppositions trigger object agreement, we'd expect less variation?
  Also the suffix is not a presupposition trigger, we know this from the
have-construction
